# Comparing multiple distributions

This project aims to is to compare distributions of competetion times in various swimming categories. The dataset is stored in the "data" directory, and the analysis is conducted using the R programming language.

## Directories

The project is structured as follows:

- /multiple-distributions
    - Bin
        - source.rmd
        - source.md
    - Data
        - SwimmingTimes.csv
    - Plots
        - generated_plots.png
    - Report
        - Report-Comparison-of-multiple-distributions.pdf



- **bin**: This directory contains the source code files required to run the analysis.
  - `source.rmd`: This R script is the main entry point for running the exploratory data analysis. It contains the code that reads the dataset and performs various data processing and visualization tasks.
  
  - `source.md`: This markdown file provides an alternative interface for running the analysis interactively. It contains the same code as `source.rmd` but provides easy accessablity along with a computational narrative.

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis.
  - `SwimmingTimes.csv`: The CSV file that contains time taken by athletes in 5 swimming categories. The file is required for running the analysis. Please ensure that it is located in this directory.

- **Plots**: This directory contains eda plots made for descriptive analysis.
- **Report**: This directory contains a detailed report on the analysis in pdf format.
